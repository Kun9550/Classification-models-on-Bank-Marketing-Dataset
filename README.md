This project focuses on the Bank Marketing Dataset (bank_full.csv), which contains 45,211 observations, 16 features, and 1 target variable. It is a publicly available dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/, which captures information on the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank.

This project aims to evaluate and compare various predictive models to determine which approach can most effectively enhance the accuracy of customer targeting in future marketing campaigns.

Compared with the classical machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and k-nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
